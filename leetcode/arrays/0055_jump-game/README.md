# 55. Jump Game

[ğŸ”— LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/)

## Solution

### Just do it

#### Explanation

The key insight of this problem is to solve the problem backwards.

Starting from the end, we set our "objective" here.
We try to find a space with a jump that can reach it.

If we can't find it, it means that there is no jump that can reach the end.

If we find it,
we update our "objective" to this 1 jump before the end.

Then repeat this process, until we reach the start.

#### Manual Run

```python
nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
```

objective | back_step | prev_step
--- | --- | ---
4 | 1 | 1
3 | 1 | 1
2 | 1 | 3
1 | 1 | 2

```python
return True
```

#### Time Complexity

- O(n) -> We transverse the array a single time.

#### Space Complexity

- O(1) -> We only create integer variables.
