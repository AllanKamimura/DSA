# 169. Majority Element

[ğŸ”— LeetCode Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/)

## Solution

### Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

#### Explanation
Since we know that the majority number appears at least (n//2 + 1) times in the list, all the other numbers are going to appear at most (n//2) times. So the algorithm is going to cancel out all candidates, but the one that appears at least (n//2 + 1).



#### Manual Run

Example 3:

i  |value | candidate | count | zeroed
--- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---
0 | 2 | 2 | 1 | True
1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | False
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | False
3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | True
4 | 1 | 2 | 2 | False
5 | 2 | 2 | 1 | False
6 | 1 | 2 | 2 | False

#### Time Complexity

- O(n) -> We transverse the array a single time.

#### Space Complexity

- O(1) -> We only create integer variables.
